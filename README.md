The code repository encapsulates the fundamental concepts presented in our paper. The implementation details of the spatiotemporal forecasting models are currently withheld but are intended for release upon the paper's acceptance into publication.

For the implementation details of the Node Prompting Module (NPM), please refer to `Models/node_prompt.py`. The `train.py` script contains the implementation of the Target-Skewed Backward (TSB) training strategy.

Thanks to `CrossCityTransfer22` for their fantastic source code.
